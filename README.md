As a former waiter, bartender, and barista with a Logistics & Supply Chain Management diploma, I bring a unique blend of customer service and logistics expertise to the table.  While I enjoyed working in these fields, since January 2022 I have set my sights on a new career path in the IT field.

I am passionate about creating user-friendly, visually appealing websites and applications that meet the needs of clients and customers alike. I am also committed to learning and mastering back-end technologies to become a full-stack web developer.
