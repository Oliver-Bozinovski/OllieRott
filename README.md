I'm a passionate and self-motivated Front End Developer who transitioned into the tech industry just a year ago. With years of rich experience in the HORECA and logistics and supply management sectors, I bring unique problem-solving abilities and a diverse perspective to my development work. I pride myself on my consistency, ability to face challenges head-on, and a continuous appetite for learning.
I am both a team player who thrives in collaborative settings, and an independent worker capable of managing projects single-handedly. My past experience in the dynamic and challenging sectors of HORECA and supply chain logistics have reinforced these strengths, setting me apart in the realm of front-end development.
Recently, I completed an intensive course in Front End Development, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. This program amplified my analytical capabilities and my knack for effective, user-friendly design - preparing me to tackle and excel in various complex projects.
I believe that every team, just like every website, benefits from having diverse, adaptable, and resilient members. With my blend of experiences and skills, I aim to bring these qualities to every project I undertake.
